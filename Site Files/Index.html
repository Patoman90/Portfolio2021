                        This is a portfollio website made by Patrick Trollip to showcase to employers his ethics, skills and drive for perfection and long term plans.
                        The website uses various web technologies to demonstrate some of his abilities. Please consider that this project was made because I wanted to do something productive with my spare time
                        as a coding student. It is a project made by myself as a student and makes a good starting point to gain experinece as a developer in achieving a start as a developer with an employer.
                        I hope that the small portfollio website will help me land a job. I used visual studio code as my toolbox for building this.

                            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                            <p>I am Patrick, a Irish coder/developer,martial artist, fitness enthusiast, locksporter and lock picker with a security background. I enjoy learning new skills and  
                                gaining useful knowledge that is applicable for now and in the future. I am striving for functionality and perfection in what I do and also humble enough that I know that perfection is a journey and not a destination.
                                As such I know I will always have something to learn and improve upon in life. I enjoy being productive with my time and have learnt that I am a very resilient and able to solve problems I am faced with and have the patience to do so.  
                            </p>
                            <h2>What education have you got?</h2>
                            <p> I completed the leaving cert in 2010 and did Kenpo karate throughout. I went to college and gained my FETAC6 in Security Business administration gaining student of the year my first year. I then studied a diploma in criminology and psychology at city colleges.
                                Still hungry for more knowledge I learnt locksmithing after learning basic lockpicking skills and got a certification in Locksmithing.
                                I then did a course in intruder alarm and access control at FETAC 5.
                                I learnt some first aid with the Irish red cross and did duties with them for a period of time.
                                I decided to learn to code in 2019 to have a career change and studied with the code institute and used multiple online sources to help me learn too.
                                Next I would like to further my developer and coding knowledge and experience and also gain my first Blackbelt in my martial arts study.
