                            I am a self motivated person who decided to have a career change and move into IT. I took the initiative to I worked a full-time job and made the time to code and retrain at home.
                            I have covered and used the modern web languages and have a interest in coding and programming and want to keep learning more and developing myself in the areas of Web developing particularly Javascript, Angular and Python3.
                            I also have a interest in cyber security and will dive into that in the near future either as a career or just a hobby on the side.

                        <h2>Work experience:</h2>
                        <p class="text-left"> My work experience involves coding and developing websites and pages hands on by myself when working full-time in the Security industry for 12+ hours a shift.
                            I have work experience using modern web languages to develop on my own and then do my best to debug and problem solve to find a solution to complex code related issues.
                            As a junior webdeveloper I have had experience working with the interactive front end and middle and then working on the backend with databases and local and remote servers.
                            I have learnt to collaborate with other developers and won first prize with them for our student hackathon in 2019. Being determined and Resilient has helped me to cope under pressure
                            and find solutions to problems in development. I am also not afraid to ask for guidance and try help where my current skill allows me to.

                            My other work experience to date has been in the security industry working as part of a team and on my own in a role that requires someone who can be relied upon
                            to get their work done under time contraints for long periods of time and still deliver the client and customers the result they expect.
                            My prior work experience to coding has had me volunteering for charities and the redcross. I have worked where team work and clear communication has been used.

                        <h2>Education:</h2>
                        <p> I graduated Secondary school at Newpark Comprehensive school in 2010. I then took a year off to try join the defense forces but I could not due to medical history.

                            In May 2019 I decided to change my career for my new interest in coding and wanted to persue a career in it. I did a intense Web Developer course with the only accredited provider in europe while working full-time. 
                            In March 2020 I graduated and became a junior fullstack webdeveloper with hands on coding experience under my belt.
                            I am going now expanding upon what I have learnt, building projects, and looking at learning Angular and Cyber security on Udemy.
